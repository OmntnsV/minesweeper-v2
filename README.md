# Omntns-Sweeper Reatomized [WIP]

Look at the [previous version](https://omntnsv.github.io/minesweeper/) to experience legacy version.

## Why new version?

The previous version was made with pure JavaScript back in the days. Time has passed and I have learned a bunch of new stuff since then, so I wanted to redo the project with new technologies and better practices. Furthermore, this project's fate is to turn me (peasant JavaScript developer ðŸ’€) into a based TypeScript enjoyer. And since I use shadcn for this project, there might be a chance to stop hating Tailwind CSS.

## What's new?

### For common user:
- Fancy new appearance
- Fancy new animations
- Fancy new ~~features~~ bugs

### For those looking to hire me ðŸ‘€:
- Fancy new type safety
- Fancy new reactivity

### Bug fixes:
- First cell clicked is now impossible to be mined
- Flagged empty cell now unflags when revealed by chain reaction

## Techstack

- Nuxt 3
- TypeScript
- Shadcn
- Tailwind CSS
- Vercel

> Note: This project is still in development. The game is not fully functional yet.

> Why 'Reatomized'? Because I like the word 'Reatomized'.
